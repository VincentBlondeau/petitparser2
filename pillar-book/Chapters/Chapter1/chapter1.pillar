The easiest way to start this tutorial is to use Moose. 
Moose is a software and data analysis platform that has everything we need already installed.

Alternatively, you can download clean Pharo 6 image and install PetitParser2 using the following command:


[[[
Metacello new
    	baseline: 'PetitParser2';
	repository: 'github://kursjan/petitparser2';
    	load
]]]
