JK: This class needs some really searious refactoring.

There are mixed parsing tests, with properties accessors and some other (unknown) assertions.

Would be also cool, to have some basi test suite, to which one can plug his own interpret and it will invoke set of tests. Now there is a duplication between this class and PP2Interpret test.
